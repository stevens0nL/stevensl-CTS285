### Rubric-Based Self-Evaluation

| Criteria | Score (1-5) | Justification |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Functional Application** | 5/5 | App works: Register, login, view dashboard, logout. Tested with multiple users; session persists. |
| **Learning Demonstration** | 5/5 | PROCESS.md shows 15+ prompts, iterations, and genuine challenges (e.g., rerun issues). Demonstrates growth from zero knowledge. |
| **Code Quality** | 4/5 | Organized, commented, error-handling (e.g., validation). Could improve with functions for modularity, but MVP-focused. |
| **Git Workflow** | 5/5 | Followed: Issue #1 ("Build Citizen Wellness Portal"), branch `feature/orange-streamlit-001`, made commits (e.g., "Add login form", "Implement dashboard"), PR with description. |
| **Growth Mindset** | 5/5 | Documented confusions (e.g., reruns vs. Flask) and resolutions. Learned Streamlit effectively via AI. |

**Overall Score:** 24/25. Strengths: Complete, iterative learning. Weakness: Code could be more modular. Ready for submission.
