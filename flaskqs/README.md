# Flask Quickstart Lab

### Introduction

Hello! This is an individual assignment. The Algorithm has determined that you should learn Flask and Streamlit. This assignment concerns Flask and should take about two hours.

## Tasks

1. **Visit and Bookmark the Flask Documentation**  
   Visit and bookmark: [https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/)

2. **Installation**  
   Work through the "Installation" section of the Flask documentation. It's recommended to create a virtual environment for this project. If you need help with virtual environments, ask your instructor or refer to Python's documentation on `venv`.

3. **Quickstart**  
   Work through the "Quickstart" section until you have the basic simple microblog (the Quickstart program) working. This involves setting up a minimal Flask application.

4. **Repository Setup**  
   - Put your code in a folder on your CTS 285 repository named `flaskqs`.  
   - Include a `README.md` file in the `flaskqs` folder with notes you gathered, such as how to install and start the application.

## Submission

Your submission link should point to the `flaskqs` folder in your CTS 285 repository.

## Notes

- **Installation Notes**:  
  To install Flask, use `pip install Flask` within your virtual environment. Activate the virtual environment with `source venv/bin/activate` (on macOS/Linux) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (on Windows).

- **Running the Application**:  
  After setting up the Quickstart code, run the app with `flask run` or `python app.py` (depending on your setup). The app typically runs on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

- **Additional Tips**:  
  Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher recommended). If you encounter issues, check the Flask documentation or seek help from your instructor.

Good luck with your Flask learning! If you have questions, feel free to ask.
